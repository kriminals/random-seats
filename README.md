## Welcome to Random Desk Sitting
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To get started, type the number of your class students in the box. Now you can place your students randomly, based on their catalogue number.

Find [here](https://morning-plains-92873.herokuapp.com/) a working demo deployed on ~~Azure~~ heroku.
